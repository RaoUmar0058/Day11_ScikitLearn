# 📊 Day 11 – Scikit-Learn & Linear Regression

### 🧠 100 Days of Data Science Challenge by Khadija Rao

This repository contains my **Day 11 project**, where I explored the **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)** library — one of the most powerful tools in Python for machine learning.  

The focus of today’s learning was on **Linear Regression**, understanding how machines learn relationships between variables.

## 🌟 Project Overview
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict outcomes based on input data.  
Using **scikit-learn**, I:
- Trained a regression model  
- Visualized predictions  
- Compared actual vs. predicted values  

This notebook demonstrates the basic workflow of a machine learning model — from importing data to evaluating results.

## 🧩 Libraries Used
- Python 3.13  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the notebook file (`Day11_ScikitLearn_LinearRegression.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Run all cells sequentially to see the code, visualizations, and results.  

```bash
jupyter notebook Day11_ScikitLearn_LinearRegression.ipynb
```

## ✨ Reflection

Every dataset is like a quiet conversation —  
and today, through Linear Regression, I learned how to listen.  

This day reminded me that even simple algorithms can uncover deep truths hidden within numbers.  
Learning Scikit-Learn wasn’t just about code — it was about understanding how machines think, predict, and learn.  

Each step in this 100 Days of Data Science journey brings me closer to the beautiful intersection of logic, creativity, and curiosity.
